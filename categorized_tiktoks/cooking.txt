 Breakdown
 
 Wifi 💚
 - Worked well with no issues!
 
 Outlets 💛
 - Plugs are scarce here. It's an older building, so there aren't many outlets to begin with and then some of the outlets that do exist, don't work. We went when it wasn't busy, so we were able to find plug access. However, when it is busy that will for sure be an issue for some people.
 
 Seating 💚
 - This cafe makes the most of their space! They've got a row of smaller tables along the wall, a high top bar, and a second room with a larger communal table and extra seating as well!
 
 Hours 💚
 - 8am - 5pm
 
 Parking 💚
 - Free parking right out front with a 90 minute limit. Otherwise, there’s free parking in the surrounding area. If you live in Dinky or Como, this is also totally walkable!
 
 Food 💛
 - They've got a case full of delicious looking sweet treats! No full meals though, but they are right next door to a few different restaurants, including @bluedoorpub that are great for lunch. Also a 10 min walk from Dinkytown with lots more food options.
 
 Drink Flavors 💛
 - We didn't love our drinks. The espresso flavor is great! But the extra flavors/syrups really weren't our favorite. We got Brown Butter Lattes and they didn't taste anything like brown butter, but were instead bitter orange flavored with bits of orange shavings in the drink? Not what we were expecting at all.
 
 Price 💚
 - Very reasonably priced!
 
 Sound Levels 💚
 - Decent sound levels. Good music was playing, but please note that everyone can hear every single conversation around you. It’s probably okay to take a call here, but overheard a lot of conversations around us.
 
 Unique Features/Vibes ❤️
 - This cafe is located super close to the U of M campus in the Como neighborhood! Located inside the old @bcwb_mn . Aside from that, nothing super unique about it. It’s a great place to get work done or study since it’s so close to @umntwincities

They have fun things to check out in the beginning & after you will walk from to the entrance of the pumpkin trail which seemed to be about 10-15 minutes. The whole event took us about an 1.5 hours, but you could definitely walk through quicker.  Tickets range from $18-26 for adults / $14-22 for children & 65+ adults. #fall #jackolanternspectacular #pumpkin #pumpkins #jackolantern #mnzoo #halloweendecor #fallactivities #fallfun #foodblogger #minnesota #like #onlyinmn #exploremn #food #pumpkinart #twincities #applevalley

  Title: Peruvian-inspired crispy rice salad! I *believe* the dish went viral by @dr.vegan, but this was a trend that was hard to trace back. The original recipe is nam khao from Laos, which uses lots of fresh herbs and cucumbers and peanuts and looks fab. Follow Dr Vegan’s recipe. I just wanted to do a little spin! Peruvian inspired crispy rice: 2 cups cooked garlic rice 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tsp cumin 2 tbsp avocado oil Aji amarillo dressing: 1/3 cup mayo Juice and zest of 1 lime 1/2 cup cilantro 3 tbsp aji Amarillo paste or 4 peppers 2 cloves garlic Salt Would be great with roasted chicken but I didn’t feel like making all that #crispyrice #crispyricesalad #ricesalad #saladrecipe #peruvianfood #ajiamarillo #salsacriolla #redonions #cilantro #lime #garlicrice #garlic #garlicgirls

  Title: hot honey halloumi chopped salad with crispy cumin chickpeas & strawberry basil! RECIPE 1 (14.5 oz) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 tsp olive oil 1 tsp cumin ½ tsp onion salt 4 small Persian cucumbers, finely diced (about 1 ½ cups) 1 heaping cup finely chopped strawberries ½ small red onion, finely chopped ¾ cup thinly sliced basil 8 oz halloumi Hot honey  Lime Balsamic Vinaigrette  1 large clove garlic (or 2 small), finely chopped  Juice of 1 lime ¼ cup balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp olive oil Preheat oven to 425 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and add the chickpeas along with olive oil, cumin, and onion salt.

  Title: Did you know that in Naples we drink “ lemonade with open legs”? Yes, you heard right! Open legs lemonade is a refreshing neapolitan drink, which is drunk in the street, as a digestif after meals. But why is it "with open legs"? It's because the very moment you add a pinch of baking soda in the glass, the drink "erupts". That’s when you open your legs, pray you won’t get wet, and drink it as fast as you can!🍋🍋🍋  #naples #napoli #italy #lemonade #italianfood #italiatravel #limon #limonada #limonitaliano #instagram #instagramreels #comidaitaliana #italia #foodtok

  Title: Replying to @❤️ MELT IN YOUR MOUTH EGGPLANT Nutritional value: 15.3 g dietary fiber, 38.4 g protein, 350 g veggies + fruit Prep: <10 min Cook time: <20 min Serves: 1   Ingredients: •1 medium eggplant •sea salt •2 tbsp olive oil or any other oil with a high smoke point    Tahini labneh pomegranate molasses dip •1 large garlic clove, grated •30 ml fresh lemon juice + more to taste •30 g well-stirred good quality tahini •¼ tsp fine sea salt •1-2 tbsp ice water, depends on how thick you like the sauce •120 g labneh or full-fat Turkish yogurt •2 tsp pomegranate molasses   Garnish:  •2 tbsp pomegranate seeds •½ tbsp of each: pomegranate molasses, teared-up flat-leaf parsley and mint   Method: -Slice eggplant in half, lengthwise and score the flesh in a crosshatch pattern. Sprinkle evenly with salt and leave it for 30 min to draw out excess moisture (removes the bitter taste & prevents mushiness), then gently squeeze the moisture out and pat dry with a paper towel -Preheat oven to 450°F/230°C. Heat oil in a non-stick ovenproof skillet on medium-high heat until it’s shimmering and just begins to smoke. Add eggplant, cut side down and let it sear and caramelize in 4-5 min. Place pan in the oven and roast for 12 min until they are completely soft but not mushy. Then transfer to paper towel-lined plate to blot excess oil.  -While eggplant is roasting, mix tahini with garlic, lemon juice, salt and labneh by hand or with an immersion blender. Then gradually add water until it becomes smooth, creamy and the consistency you like. Now mix in pomegranate molasses until combined. Taste and adjust to your liking. Remove 2 tbsp for garnish. Then set aside until ready to serve, but stir again before serving -When eggplant is ready, transfer the dip to a plate, top with eggplant, followed by a drizzle of pomegranate molasses and the reserved tahini mixture, herbs and pomegranate seeds. Enjoy as is or as a side!   #eggplant #aubergine #eggplantrecipe #auberginerecipe #thomaskellerzucchini #thomaskeller #tahini #labneh #diprecipe #pomegranatemolasses #highproteindinner #fiberrich #glutenfreerecipe #HealthyRecipe #probioticfood #guthealthrecipes #gutfriendlyrecipe

  Title: Herb Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup  *Ingredients* For the tomato soup: 2 cups cherry tomatoes 2 garlic heads  1 onion 1 red bell pepper 1 teaspoon chilli flakes ½ cup water ¾ cup coconut milk/ heavy cream ¼ cup parmigiano reggiano Salt & pepper 2 tbsp. olive oil For the sandwich: 2 slices of bread of your choice (I chose sourdough) 2 slices gouda cheese  ⅓ cup shredded mozzarella  butter 1 tbsp. olive oil 1 teaspoon fresh parsley (chopped) *Instructions* Make the soup: In a baking dish place cherry tomatoes, garlic heads, onion, red pepper, salt, pepper, chili flakes, olive oil and mix. Bake at 400F for 45-50 min or until vegetables are softened. Transfer the vegetables into a blender. Once smooth, transfer onto a medium size saucepan.  Place the saucepan over high-medium heat, add water, coconut milk and mix. Cook for a few minutes and then add parmigiano reggiano. Lower the heat and cook the soup for about 10 minutes or until it has thickened a bit. Stir often.  Make the sandwich: Using a butter knife spread the butter over the bread (only from the outer side of the sandwich). Place the bread slices on a pan over medium heat and add the cheese.  Gently, place one slice over the other and toast until the bottom bread slice becomes golden brown, flip over and toast the other side.  Once ready, mix olive oil with parsley and spread over the top of the sandwich. Serve warm with the tomato soup. #grilledcheese #tomatosoup #asmr #toast #brunchideas
